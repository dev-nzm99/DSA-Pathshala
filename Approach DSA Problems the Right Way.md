When I first started with DSA, I thought I was dumb.  
Seriously.  

I would open a problem, read it three times, and still have no clue what to do. Then I’d click on the solution, copy it, and feel guilty like I was cheating.  

But with time, I realized something: everyone goes through this phase. Even the best coders you see on YouTube or Codeforces started the same way — confused, stuck, and dependent on solutions.

And the right approach to DSA is not to avoid that phase, but to go through it in the right way. 

Let me explain.

## Stage 1: The First 10 Questions – “I Don’t Get It”

Think about the first 10 problems you solved.

- Arrays felt confusing.
- Loops went out of control.
- Edge cases made you cry.

You’d open the editorial or solution almost every time.

And that’s okay. Because at this stage, you’re not learning to solve problems. You’re learning to understand approaches.

Just like when we first learned to write essays, we copied sentences from books or teachers. Slowly, we learned to write in our own words.

DSA is the same. The first 10 problems are not about “solving” but about absorbing.

## Stage 2: 100 Questions – “I’ve Seen This Before”

After grinding through 100 problems, something amazing happens.

Your brain starts to whisper:  
“Wait… this problem feels familiar.”

Suddenly, new problems don’t look completely new. They remind you of something you solved earlier.

- This looks like that sliding window trick.
- This feels like prefix sums.
- This is probably binary search in disguise.

You still check the solutions sometimes, but now instead of feeling lost, you feel:  
“Ohhh, I was almost there.”

That feeling of almost solving it is a sign of growth.

## Stage 3: 200 Questions – “I Can Guess the Solution”

By the time you’ve solved 200 problems, your brain has built a small library of patterns.

Now, when you read a problem, you don’t just stare blankly. You start making predictions:

- Maybe I can use a HashMap.
- Maybe recursion + memoization works here.
- Maybe I can optimize with two pointers.

You won’t always be right, but you’re no longer clueless.

It’s like learning to play chess. In the beginning, you only see one move ahead. After 200 games, you start predicting three moves ahead. You don’t know the exact answer, but you know the direction.

## Stage 4: 500 Questions – “I Can Solve Without Help”

This is where the real magic happens.

Somewhere around your 500th problem, you stop running to the solutions page. Instead, you fight with the problem. You sit for an hour. You dry run with small examples. You sketch things out.

And suddenly, it clicks.

That’s when you realize:  
“I can think on my own now. I don’t always need a solution.”

This stage feels like learning to ride a bike. At first, you needed training wheels (solutions). Then you wobbled a lot (200 problems). But by 500, you’re riding freely, with balance, without fear.

## The Real Truth: It’s Not About Numbers

Now, let me break a myth: there’s no magic number.  

Some people click at 200 problems.  
Some need 500.  
Some take 1000.  

And that’s perfectly fine. Because we’re human. We learn at different speeds.

The goal isn’t to brag “I solved 800 problems.” The goal is to develop the thinking ability.

DSA is not about memorizing solutions. It’s about building the feeling of problem solving. That moment when you sit with a new problem and instead of panic, you feel curiosity.

That shift from fear to curiosity is what makes you good at DSA.

## Why This Matters Beyond Coding

Here’s the thing: once your brain learns this process, it doesn’t stay limited to coding.  

You start approaching life problems the same way:  

- Break them into smaller parts.
- Look for patterns.
- Reuse solutions from past experiences.
- Keep iterating until it works.

I’ve seen this myself. DSA doesn’t just train you for interviews; it trains you for real-world problem solving.

## Final Words

So if you’re at the start of your DSA journey and you feel like a failure because you keep checking solutions, don’t worry. You’re not failing. You’re just at **Stage 1**.

The journey goes like this:

- 10 problems → You copy.
- 100 problems → You recognize.
- 200 problems → You predict.
- 500 problems → You solve independently.

The key is not how fast you reach there. The key is that you keep moving.

One day, you’ll open a problem, and your brain will instantly know where to start. That’s when you’ll smile and think:  
**“Wow, I’ve come a long way.”**

And trust me, that’s one of the best feelings in the world.
